# 00 — Product Brief

## Product name
**Native IQ for Slack** (DeepNative)

## One-liner
Turn Slack conversations and connected company data into live insights and auto-managed tasks, with role-aware automation and an LLM-orchestrated dashboard.

## Primary users & outcomes
- ICs: never miss action items; get summaries, reminders, and automations.
- Managers: status, risks, decisions, SLA heatmaps; assign/approve automations.
- Execs/Owners: cross-team trends, KPIs, and decision logs.

## Core capabilities (MVP)
1. Insight Engine (Slack+docs → decisions, risks, blockers, trends).
2. Task Miner (extract tasks based on chat context across the company communication and Slack reminders).
3. Role-Aware Automations (policy-gated workflows).
4. LLM-Orchestrated Dashboard (web + Slack Home Tab).
5. Connectors via MCP (Slack, tasks, docs, git) with ACL-aware retrieval.

## Non-goals (MVP)
- Email ingestion, calendar orchestration, or non-Slack chat platforms.

## KPIs
- ≥25% fewer missed action items
- ≥30% faster status preparation
- ≥85% task-extraction F1

## Tenets
- Privacy-first (RLS, tenant keys, DLP by default).
- Explainable insights (link back to sources; “why you see this”).
- Minimal, timeless UI; fewer clicks > more features.

## Success criteria
- a fully functional dashboard with all necessary features that is deployment ready
