# 09 — Rollout and Ops

## Pilot Plan
- Install in 1–2 teams; read-only insights first
- Enable automations behind approval modals week 2
- Weekly eval review; expand connectors as requested

## Runbooks
- Queue backlog spike → autoscale consumers; widen insight batch window temporarily
- Token revocation → rotate via runbook; alert owners
- Incident (P0/P1): comms template, forensics export, customer RCA in 72h
